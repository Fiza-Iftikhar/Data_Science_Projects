# Project2 - Exploring Hacker News Posts
   - In this project, we'll work with a data set of submissions to popular technology site [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/). Hacker News is a site where user-submitted stories (known as `"posts"`) are voted and commented upon.
   - We're specifically interested in posts whose titles begin with either **Ask HN** or **Show HN**. Users submit `Ask HN` posts to ask the Hacker News community a specific question
   - Likewise, users submit `Show HN` posts to show the Hacker News community a project, product, or just generally something interesting.
   - We'll compare these two types of posts (i.e Ask HN posts and Show HN Posts) to determine the following:

        1. Do `Ask HN` or `Show HN` receive more comments on average?

        2. Do posts created at a certain time receive more comments on average?

   ### Conclusion:
 - From above graph we conclude that, the best time to recevie more comments on **Ask_HN posts** is **15:00 PM** and the best time to recevie more comments on **Show_HN** is **18:00 PM**. So, if you really wanna recevie more comments on Ask_HN and Show_HN posts on hacker news, than you should posts on those time period.
