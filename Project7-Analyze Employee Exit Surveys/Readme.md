# Project7- Analyze Employee Exit Surveys
- In this project, we'll work with exit surveys from employees of the [Department of Education, Training and Employment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Education_and_Training_(Queensland)) (DETE) and the Technical and Further Education (TAFE) institute in Queensland, Australia. We can find the TAFE exit survey [here](https://data.gov.au/dataset/ds-qld-89970a3b-182b-41ea-aea2-6f9f17b5907e/details?q=exit%20survey) and the survey for the DETE [here](https://data.gov.au/dataset/ds-qld-fe96ff30-d157-4a81-851d-215f2a0fe26d/details?q=exit%20survey).

- In this project, we'll play the role of data analyst and pretend our stakeholders want to know the following:

    * Are employees who only worked for the institutes for a short period of time resigning due to some kind of dissatisfaction? What about employees who have been there longer?
    * Are younger employees resigning due to some kind of dissatisfaction? What about older employees?

## Conlusion
   - From the above visualization, we see that new employees are least dissatisfied with their jobs than others. And the majority of the employees who are dissatisfied with their jobs are Veterans, who have more than 11 years of experience in a company.
