# Project12-Find the best Markets to Advertise In(Using Statistics)

- In this project, **we aim to find the two best markets to advertise our product in** â€” we're working for an e-learning company that offers courses on programming. Most of our courses are on the web and mobile development, but we also cover many other domains, like data science, game development, etc.
- Our company will launch a new course of web and mobile development in different countries and monthly subscription charges would be **$59**. We aim to find out in which country we should launch our course. 
- **freeCodeCamp** is a completely free e-learning site that offers a variety of courses on web development. We chose their data because they run a popular Medium publication that currently has 600,000+ followers. More so, the 2017 survey attracted new coders with different interests.


### Check the relevancy of the data according to our area of interest i.e web and mobile development

- From our analysis, we can see that 86.2% of data shows the relevancy towards our aim. Which means that most of the people in this survey (roughly 86%) are interested in either web or mobile development. These figures offer us a strong reason to consider this sample representative for our population of interest.


### We narrow down our analysis to only four countries because these countries having the highest frequency in the frequency table, which means we have a decent amount of data for each.

### CONCLUSION:
   - From analysis we can see that one country we should advertise in is the US. Lots of new coders live there and they are willing to pay a good amount of money each month. We sell subscriptions at a price of **\$59** per month, and Canada seems to be the best second choice because people there are willing to pay roughly **$93** per month, compared to India and the United Kingdom. The data suggests strongly that we shouldn't advertise in the UK, 
   - At this point, it seems that we have several options:
        - Advertise in the US, India, and Canada by splitting the advertisement budget in various combinations:
                - 80% for the US, 10% for India, 10% for Canada.
                - 50% for the US, 30% for India, 20% for Canada; etc.
        - Advertise only in the US and India, or the US and Canada. Again, it makes sense to split the advertisement budget unequally. For instance:
                - 70% for the US, and 30% for India.
                - 70% for the US, and 30% for Canada; etc.
                - Advertise only in the US.

   - The only solid conclusion we reached is that the US would be a good market to advertise in.
   - For the second best market, it wasn't clear-cut what to choose between India and Canada. We decided to send the results to the marketing team so they can use their domain knowledge to take the best decision.
