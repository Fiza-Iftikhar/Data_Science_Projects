# Project12-Find the best Markets to Advertise In(Using Statistics)

- In this project, **we aim to find the two best markets to advertise our product in** â€” we're working for an e-learning company that offers courses on programming. Most of our courses are on the web and mobile development, but we also cover many other domains, like data science, game development, etc.
- Our company will launch a new course of web and mobile development in different countries and monthly subscription charges would be **$59**. We aim to find out in which country we should launch our course. 
- **freeCodeCamp** is a completely free e-learning site that offers a variety of courses on web development. We chose their data because they run a popular Medium publication that currently has 600,000+ followers. More so, the 2017 survey attracted new coders with different interests.
