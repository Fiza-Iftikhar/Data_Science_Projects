# Project1 - Profitable App Profiles for the Google Play Market
  Our aim in this project is to find mobile app profiles that are profitable for Google Play markets. We're working as data analysts for a company that builds Android mobile apps, and our job is to enable our team of developers to make data-driven decisions with respect to the kind of apps they build.

  At our company, we only build apps that are free to download and install, and our main source of revenue consists of in-app ads. This means that our revenue for any given app is mostly influenced by the number of users that use our app. Our goal for this project is to analyze data to help our developers understand what kinds of apps are likely to attract more users.

 - [A data set](https://www.kaggle.com/lava18/google-play-store-apps/home) containing data about approximately ten thousand Android apps from Google Play

### Conclusion
   - From the above analysis we conclude that, the most installed app categories are Communication, vedio players and social apps. And these app categories have a big competitor like whatsapp, Youtube, Facebook and instagram etc. So, to decide which app we should develop we should further do an analysis according to the business requirments. Or we should discuss with the top management as they know what kind of app will be possible for them to develop according to the needs of their business requriment and decision also rely on the budget constraints.
