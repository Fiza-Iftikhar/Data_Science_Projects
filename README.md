## Industrial Data Science Postgraduate Certification Training Program 
   Industrial Data Science Postgraduate Certification Training Program is an 8 monthly program affiliated with NED University of Engineering and Technology Karachi, Pakistan. This Certification program is designed to provide a hands-on training experience on real-world datasets. This training covers everything that any Data Scientist should know. All projects are based on a real-world scenario that helps us to apply different data science skills to solve a real-world problem. 
### What I have learned 
  - **Data Analysis:** In this course, I have learned how we can use **Python data structures, functions, NumPy** and **Pandas** to critically manipulate, clean, transform and examine the data, and extract the insights to the useful information from the data. And taking the decision based upon the data analysis. 
  - **Data Visualization:** To show the graphical representation of the information from the data we mainly focus on Data Visualization or Exploratory Data Analysis techniques using the most popular Pythonâ€™s library **Matplotlib**. Learn **Seaborn** for Advanced EDA or to improve plot aesthetics. 
  - **Statistics:** Learn some new and more powerful statistical techniques to organize and visualize relatively large amount of data, which will make the process of finding patterns considerably less difficult.
