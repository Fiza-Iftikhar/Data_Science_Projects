# Project4- Analyzing and Visualizing Earnings Based on Different Majors
- We'll be working with a dataset on the job outcomes of students who graduated from college between 2010 and 2012. The original data on job outcomes was released by [American Community Survey](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs/), which conducts surveys and aggregates the data.
- Here are some of the columns in the dataset:

  * `Rank` - Rank by median earnings (the dataset is ordered by this column).
  * `Major_code` - Major code.
  * `Major` - Major description.
  * `Major_category` - Category of major.
  * `Total` - Total number of people with major.
  * `Sample_size` - Sample size (unweighted) of full-time.
  * `Men` - Male graduates.
  * `Women` - Female graduates.
  * `ShareWomen` - Women as share of total.
  * `Employed` - Number employed.
  * `Median` - Median salary of full-time, year-round workers.
  * `Low_wage_jobs` - Number in low-wage service jobs.
  * `Full_time` - Number employed 35 hours or more.
  * `Part_time` - Number employed less than 35 hours.

### Our aim is to identify:

   * Dominant Major_category for Men and Women
   * Top Majors in Dominant category according to the highest Employment
   * Top Majors in Dominant category according to highest Median Salary
